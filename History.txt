== 0.6.1 / 2012-08-07

* 1 Fixed a bad require statement that prevented the gem from working
     within Rails.

== 0.6.0 / 2012-08-06

* 1 A developer-centric release that includes RSpec tests and support for
    bundler.

== 0.5.0 / 2012-03-09

* 1 The breadcrumbs string that is returned is now html_safe for maximum
    convenience.

* 2 Inidividual breadcrumb titles are gracefully truncated to 30
    characters by default. This limit can be overridden for all
    breadcrumbs if necessary.

== 0.4.0 / 2012-02-14

Some minor enhancements to ensure that the gem functions out-of-the-box with
support for graphic separators between the breadcrumbs.

* 1 Added a "separator" option to the breadcrumbs method.

      breadcrumbs(['Home', root_path, 'Admin', admin_path],
        :direction => 'left', :separator => '&lt;')

* 2 Values for the "direction" option can now be symbols.

      breadcrumbs(['Home', root_path, 'Admin', admin_path],
        :direction => :left)

== 0.3.0 / 2012-02-07

The plugin was converted into a gem, verified on Ruby 1.8.7, and updated for
Ruby 1.9.x and Rails 3.x.

* 1 The name of the gem was changed to "active_breadcrumbs" because the
    name "breadcrumbs" was already taken at Rubygems.org.

* 2 Added Ruby magic so the breadcrumbs method becomes available in both the
    ActionView and ActionController Rails modules. The benefit is that
    the breadcrumbs method can be used in views or controllers without the
    user having to use any code inclusion mechanism ('requires', etc.).
    
* 3 Added better documentation.

* 4 Put the gem repository on gitHub for public consumption.

== 0.2.0 / 2009-12-21

The major change was that the breadcrumbs functionality was organized as a
plugin.

* 1 The format of a breadcrumbs trail changed in this version. A typical
    example:

      @cookie_trail = breadcrumbs([ 'Home', root_url,
                                    'Admin', admin_url,
                                    'Presentations', admin_presentations_url],
                                    :direction => 'left')

    It would have been nice to use an ordered Hash (key entry order is 
    preserved in Ruby 1.9.x) for the individual breadcrumbs, but a lot of
    people are still using Rails 3.x with Ruby 1.8.7, which does not have
    ordered hashes. It's still a simpler format than previously.

* 2 Easily used in views or controllers.

* 1 Supported the creation of a very simple breadcrumbs trail. Perfect for a
    structure-based breadcrumbs trail.

* 2 Breadcrumbs trails can be specified using the following format:

      <%= show_breadcrumbs( [ 'Home', ['main'],
                              'Tools', ['tools'],
                              'Antimatter', ['tools', 'antimatter']], 
                            :direction => 'left') %>
